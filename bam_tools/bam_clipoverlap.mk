# Merges overlapping paired-end reads using ClipOverlap from bamUtil (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BamUtil:_clipOverlap)
# When two mates overlap, this tool will clip the record's whose clipped region would have the lowest average quality.
# This step is needed if running Strelka/Strelka2 to avoid double-counting overlapping pairs.
